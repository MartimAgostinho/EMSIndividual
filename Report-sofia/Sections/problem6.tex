\section{Problem 6}

\subsection{Pressure sensor - Principle of operation}

A common way of designing a pressure sensor is by using a Wheatstone bridge. The bridge is made up of four resistors sensible to mechanical stress. 

One implementation of this sensor is shown in Figure \ref{fig:wheatstone_bridge}. When pressure is applied each resistor either compress or stretch. These sensors are design in order to the opposite resistors in the bridge change their resistance accordingly, i.e., in the example of Figure \ref{fig:wheatstone_bridge}, $R - \triangle R$ decrease by compression, $R + \triangle R$ increase by stretching\textsuperscript{\cite{TI-Design-Resistive-Bridge-Pressure-Sensor}}. This change in resistance yields a change in the differential voltage, $V0$, which is proportional to the applied pressure.

    \label{fig:wheatstone_bridge}
\end{figure}

When the bridge is connected to a voltage source and the output voltage is measured across the bridge it is given by the Equation \ref{eq:output_voltage}:

\begin{equation}
    V_0 = V_{in}\cdot \frac{\triangle R}{R}
    \label{eq:output_voltage}
\end{equation}

Where $V_{in}$ is the input voltage, $\triangle R$ is the change in resistance and $R$ is the initial resistance of the resistors. Since $\triangle R$ is proportional to the force or pressure, Equation \ref{eq:output_voltage}
can be rewritten as:

\begin{equation}
    V_0 = V_{in}\cdot F \cdot S
    \label{eq:output_voltage_force}
\end{equation}

Where $F$ is the force or pressure and $S$ is the sensitivity of the sensor in mV per volt of excitation with full scale input, specified by the sensor manufacture\textsuperscript{\cite{TI-Design-Signal-Conditioning-Wheatstone-Resistive-Bridge-Sensors}}.

\subsection{Drip Irrigation System with Pressure Regulation}

This system automates the delivery of water to plants through a smart drip irrigation system with controlled pressure. It ensures optimal water flow and avoids overwatering or under-watering by maintaining a target pressure range of $10-30 psi$, typical for drip irrigation systems. The system uses a pressure sensor, microcontroller, and proportional solenoid valve to regulate the flow based on real-time pressure readings. Additionally, the system features a soil moisture sensor enhancing system's efficiency. In Figure \ref{fig:block-diagram} is shown a block diagram of the system.

$\rightarrow$ Compare the pressure reading to the desired range.

$\rightarrow$ If below range, open the valve by increasing the PWM duty cycle.

$\rightarrow$ If above range, restrict the valve by reducing the PWM signal.
